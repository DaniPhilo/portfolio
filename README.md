# Personal Portfolio

Visit it **[here](https://www.danielcarrascodev.com)**!

## Overview:
This is my personal portfolio, the place where I upload my different projects (Frontend, Backend and Fullstack). The goal of this site is to show my skills and interests to those interested to hire me.
It was built using React and SASS, and therefore, it doesn't use any database or backend service whatsoever.

- ### Functionalities:
The main goal of a portfolio is to show your work and provide a contact method for those interested in you. Thus, theese are the main functionalities of the site:
  1. **Projects section**: This section uses a .json file as a database, where the projects' details are stored (title, description, links...). Theese projects are tagged with different labels to make them easier to find and sort within the portfolio, and are dynamically displayed from the front.
  2. **Contact section**: The contact formulary sends an email to my private account with your name, email and message, so we can be in touch. This is done using Email.js (click [here](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/) to see the docs), and the user's email address is never stored.
  
The site is under constant improvement, and I hope to be able to implement many features in the future.
